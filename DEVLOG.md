# Development Log - Training Insights Project [2/13/2025]

## Project Setup [2/13/2025]
### Initial Setup Status
* ✅ Nx workspace created with React preset
* ✅ Basic frontend application structure in place
* ✅ Backend API setup complete
* ✅ Shared libraries initialized

### Next Steps
1. Create initial shared libraries:
   - `libs/shared/ui` for common components
   - `libs/shared/utils` for helper functions
   - `libs/data-access` for API interfaces
2. Set up backend API structure
3. Configure development environment

### Open Questions & Decisions
* Consider whether to use REST or GraphQL for API
* Determine best structure for activity data in Cosmos DB
* Plan feature library organization

## Technical Decisions & Implementation Notes [2/13/2025]

### Database Strategy
* Local Development & Testing: MongoDB
  - Provides Cosmos DB API compatibility
  - Easy containerization with Docker
  - Cost-effective for development
  - Validates data models and queries locally
* CI Environment: MongoDB in containers
  - Consistent with local development
  - Fast test execution
  - Efficient resource usage in CI
* Production: Azure Cosmos DB
  - Production workload target
  - Managed service benefits
  - Global distribution capabilities

### Testing Strategy & Philosophy
* Core Testing Principles:
  - Write failing test first
  - Implement minimum code to pass
  - Refactor while maintaining coverage
  - Prefer real dependencies over mocks
  - Keep tests simple and focused

* Testing Layers:
  1. E2E Tests (Playwright)
     - Real database interactions
     - Full user flows
     - API integration
     - File system operations
  
  2. Integration Tests
     - Service boundaries
     - Database operations
     - External service integration
  
  3. Unit Tests (Vitest)
     - Pure business logic
     - Data transformations
     - Utility functions

### Testing Infrastructure Implementation [2/13/2025]
* ✅ Test Framework Setup
  - Playwright for E2E
  - React Testing Library for components
  - Vitest for unit tests
  - MongoDB for test data persistence

* ✅ Test Utilities & Helpers
  - Shared test fixtures
  - Database cleanup procedures
  - Custom test matchers
  - Authentication helpers

* ✅ Test Data Management
  - MongoDB integration
  - Fixture loading utilities
  - Data isolation per test
  - Automated cleanup

### Backend Architecture [2/13/2025]
✅ tRPC Implementation
- Base router configuration
- Error handling middleware
- Type-safe procedures
- Authentication context
- File upload handlers

✅ Shared Library Structure
- Data access patterns
- Common interfaces
- Type definitions
- Utility functions

### Development Progress
✅ Core Infrastructure
- tRPC backend configuration
- Shared libraries setup
- Testing framework implementation
- Docker development environment

### Remaining Tasks
1. Azure Integration
   - [ ] Blob Storage setup
   - [ ] Cosmos DB configuration
   - [ ] Azure AD integration

2. Feature Development

## Environment Setup Notes [2/13/2025]
### Local Development
* Docker services:
  - MongoDB for data persistence
  - Azurite for blob storage
  - API service with hot reload

### CI Environment
* Container-based testing
* Parallel test execution
* Automated environment setup
* Performance benchmarking
