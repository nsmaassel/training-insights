# Development Log - Training Insights Project

## Project Setup - [Date: Current]

### Initial Setup Status
* ✅ Nx workspace created with React preset
* ✅ Basic frontend application structure in place
* ⏳ Backend API setup pending
* ⏳ Shared libraries pending

### Next Steps
1. Create initial shared libraries:
   - `libs/shared/ui` for common components
   - `libs/shared/utils` for helper functions
   - `libs/data-access` for API interfaces
2. Set up backend API structure
3. Configure development environment

### Open Questions & Decisions
* Consider whether to use REST or GraphQL for API
* Determine best structure for activity data in Cosmos DB
* Plan feature library organization

## Technical Decisions & Notes

### Nx Workspace Structure
* Using Vite for build tooling
* Configured for React 18+
* TypeScript strict mode enabled
* Tailwind CSS integrated

### Planned Custom Generators
1. Feature module generator
   - Creates consistent feature library structure
   - Includes test setup
   - Adds to module boundaries
2. API endpoint generator
   - Scaffolds Express route
   - Creates interface definitions
   - Sets up tests

### Development Guidelines
* Branch naming: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `chore/` prefixes
* Commit message format: `type(scope): message`
* PR template to include:
  - Feature description
  - Testing steps
  - Dependencies added
  - Migration needs

## Current Sprint: Testing Infrastructure Setup

### Testing Strategy - ✅ COMPLETED
* **TDD Approach:**
  - ✅ Write failing test first
  - ✅ Implement minimum code to pass
  - ✅ Refactor while maintaining test coverage
* **Test Layers:**
  1. E2E Tests (Playwright)
     - ✅ User journey testing
     - ✅ Critical path validation
     - ✅ Cross-browser compatibility
  2. Component Tests (React Testing Library)
     - ✅ Component behavior
     - ✅ User interactions
     - ✅ Accessibility checks
  3. Unit Tests (Vitest)
     - ✅ Business logic setup
     - ✅ Test utilities
     - ⏳ API interactions (pending backend)

### Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Configure React Testing Library
   - [x] Set up custom renders
   - [x] Define common queries
   - [x] Create test utilities

2. ✅ Enhance Playwright Setup
   - [x] Define custom commands
   - [x] Set up test data fixtures
   - [x] Configure CI-ready workflow

3. ✅ Initial Test Suite
   - [x] Homepage component tests
   - [x] Basic navigation E2E test
   - [x] File upload component test structure

## Next Sprint: Backend Setup & Shared Libraries

### Current Goals
1. 🎯 Backend API Application
   - [ ] Create Node.js API application using Nx
   - [ ] Set up Express.js with TypeScript
   - [ ] Configure API routes structure
   - [ ] Implement file upload endpoint
   - [ ] Add request validation
   - [ ] Set up testing infrastructure

2. 🎯 Shared Libraries Configuration
   - [ ] Create shared/ui library
     - Components: FileUpload, Button, Input
   - [ ] Create shared/utils library
     - File handling utilities
     - Date formatting
     - Validation helpers
   - [ ] Create data-access library
     - API interfaces
     - Data models
     - Service abstractions

3. 🎯 Frontend Refinements
   - [ ] Move file upload to shared/ui
   - [ ] Add proper error handling
   - [ ] Implement upload progress
   - [ ] Add file validation
   - [ ] Improve accessibility

### Technical Decisions Needed
* API Authentication strategy
* File upload size limits
* Error handling standardization
* API versioning approach
* Data validation patterns

### Dependencies to Add
* Express.js for API
* Multer for file uploads
* Zod for validation
* JWT for authentication
* Winston for logging
